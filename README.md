## 🌀 Quantum Entanglement Simulator (`enteglment.html`)

**Visualize and interact with quantum entanglement!**

- **Bell State Preparation:** Instantly create any of the four Bell states (|Φ⁺⟩, |Φ⁻⟩, |Ψ⁺⟩, |Ψ⁻⟩) with a click.
- **Interactive Measurement:** Measure either qubit A or B and see the entanglement effect in real time—observe how the measurement of one instantly determines the state of the other, as predicted by quantum mechanics.
- **Dynamic Canvas Visualization:** Qubits and their entanglement are visualized on a canvas, with color-coded states and a connecting line for entangled pairs.
- **State Information Panel:** Clear, real-time explanations of the current quantum state, measurement results, and the entanglement relationship.
- **Reset Functionality:** Instantly reset the system to try new experiments.
- **Mobile Friendly:** Layout, controls, and canvas adapt for small screens.
